# 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic

In 1918, a new influenza virus emerged. During this same time period World War I was taking place. The conditions of World War I (overcrowding and global troop movement) helped the 1918 flu spread. The vulnerability of healthy young adults and the lack of vaccines and treatments created a major public health crisis, causing at least 50 million deaths worldwide, including approximately 675,000 in the United States. This outbreak was among the largest disease outbreaks in modern times having long term socio-economic effects on the whole world.


## Introduction

We worked on a data oriented project to try to understand the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918 and how it can teach us valuable lessons.
We have worked on the death and mortality related aspects, economic impacts and also how social distancing helped mitigate the spread.

We researched through many papers and web content to find out accurately what happened in those times. We have tried to understand the pandemic in three ways, how it affected deaths and mortality rates, its economic impact on the world and how effective was social distancing in fighting this invisible enemy.

The reason of working on social distancing is that, it occurred in a time before antibiotics. Mankind did not have proper medication to fight against the pathogen. The best weapon in such conditions is social distancing. Hence, we tried to have a look at it.
Our findings are presented in the files given below.
