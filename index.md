# 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic

In 1918, a new influenza virus emerged. During this same time period World War I was taking place. The conditions of World War I (overcrowding and global troop movement) helped the 1918 flu spread. The vulnerability of healthy young adults and the lack of vaccines and treatments created a major public health crisis, causing at least 50 million deaths worldwide, including approximately 675,000 in the United States. This outbreak was among the largest disease outbreaks in modern times having long term socio-economic effects on the whole world.
